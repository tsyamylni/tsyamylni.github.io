                <h1 class="open-h2">What Causes Earthquakes?Tectonic Plate Movements: </h1>
                <p class="open-t1">The Earth's outer shell is divided into several large pieces called tectonic plates.</p>
                <p class="open-t1">These plates are constantly moving, and when they interact at their boundaries,</p>
                <p class="open-t1"> stress builds up. Eventually, this stress is released in the form of an earthquake</p>
                <p class="open-t1">Subduction zones, where one plate is forced beneath another,</p>
                <p class="open-t1"> are particularly prone to seismic activity.</p>
        
                <h1 class="open-h2">Effects of Earthquakes</h1>
                <h1 class="open-h3">Ground Shaking: </h1>
            
                <p class="open-t1">The primary effect of an earthquake is the shaking of the ground. The intensity of shaking can vary,</p>
                <p class="open-t1"> leading to damage to structures and infrastructure.</p>
            
                <h1 class="open-h3">Surface Rupture:</h1>
                <p class="open-t1">In some cases, the Earth's surface may rupture along the fault line, causing displacement </p>
                <p class="open-t1">and visible changes in the landscape.</p>
          
                <h1 class="open-h3">Secondary Effects:</h1>
                <p class="open-t1">Earthquakes can trigger secondary hazards such as tsunamis, landslides, and liquefaction, </p>
                <p class="open-t1">amplifying the overall impact on affected areas.</p>
           
                <h1 class="open-h2">Mitigation Strategies</h1>
                <p class="open-h3">Building Codes and Construction Practices:</p>
                <p class="open-t1">Implementing and enforcing stringent building codes ensures that structures </p>
                <p class="open-t1">are designed to withstand seismic forces. Retrofitting existing buildings </p>
                <p class="open-t1">to meet these standards can also mitigate earthquake damage.</p>

                <p class="open-h3">Early Warning Systems: </h1>
                <p class="open-t1">Developing and deploying early warning systems allows for timely alerts,</p>
                <p class="open-t1">giving people and organizations the opportunity to take protective measures before the shaking begins.</p>

                <p class="open-h3">Public Education and Preparedness:</p>
                <p class="open-t1">Educating communities about earthquake risks and implementing preparedness measures,</p>
                <p class="open-t1">such as evacuation plans and emergency supply kits, can save lives and reduce the overall impact of seismic events.</p>

                <p class="open-h3">Land Use Planning: </p>
                <p class="open-t1">Avoiding construction in high-risk areas and implementing land use planning that considers seismic hazards </p>
                <p class="open-t1">can minimize the exposure of vulnerable populations and critical infrastructure.</p>

                <h1 class="open-h2">Conclusion:</h1>
                <p class="open-t1">Earthquakes are powerful geological events that demand our attention and proactive measures to mitigate their impact. </p>
                <p class="open-t1">By understanding the causes of earthquakes and implementing effective strategies, we can work towards </p>
                <p class="open-t1">creating resilient communities that are better prepared to face the challenges posed by seismic activity.</p>
